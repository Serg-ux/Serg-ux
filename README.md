# Hi! Whatâ€™s up?

Hello, my name is Ser-ux. I'm a Penetration Tester.

## Interests

**I really, _really_ like coding**, as you can see in my GitHub profile. I've developed several projects ranging from simple logins to complete apps with databases.

As hobbies I like to go **downhill**, play **basketball** and **soccer**. Thanks to these sports I have learned to **teamwork**.

## Development skills

I've got a professional level in **Java** programming. In fact, this was the first language I learned back in 2020. I can do almost anything with it.

I also have some experience with languages such as **SQL**,**HTML**,**CSS**, **JavaScript**, **C#** or **Python**, having developed some minor projects with them.

## Other skills

Some say I'm a good leader, others say I'm not, but one thing is for sure: **I know how to work in a team**. I believe communication is the standard requirement for successful teamwork, and I make a good job encouraging this good practice.

Furthermore, despite being from Spain, I speak English on a decent level (**I currently have got a B2 language certificate**).
