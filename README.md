# Hi! Whatâ€™s up?

Hello, my name is Ser-ux. I'm a Cybersecurity Analyst.

## Interests

**I really, _really_ like coding**, as you can see in my GitHub profile. I've developed several projects ranging from simple script to complete apps.

As hobbies I like to go **downhill**, play **basketball** and **soccer**. Thanks to these sports I have learned to **teamwork**.

## Development skills

I've got a professional level in **Java** programming. In fact, this was the first language I learned back in 2020. I can do almost anything with it.

I also have some experience with languages such as **SQL**,**HTML**,**CSS**, **JavaScript**, **C#** or **Python**, having developed some minor projects with them.
